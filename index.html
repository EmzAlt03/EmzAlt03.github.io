<h2 class="h2"; style="font-size: 20px; color:goldenrod;">Bio About Me</h2>
<pre class="pre"; style="font-size: 13px; color:white;">
My name is Emre Altunsu, and I have enjoyed one activity throughout my life and that is using the internet and computer technologies.
My family is originally from Turkey, having no creditable knowledge about information technologies and their applications as a result of financial hardship as well as the isolated culture.
I have completed my VCE in 2021 and achieved an ATAR score of 83.24 which surprised me as, fun fact, during 2021 I lost all my notes, worksheets and assessments.
While waiting for the bus to arrive a gust of wind opened my bag and all contents flew across the bus terminal, but I managed to catch up just in time for exams.
I have found that studying information technology at RMIT has really provided a true understanding of the expansiveness of technology and how it has impacted humanity since its discovery.
I applied for this course to enhance knowledge on the field, to gain quality experience and begin to form a professional mindset when it comes to employment.
</pre>
<h3 class="h3"; style= "font-size: 15px; color:lightgoldenrodyellow;">My Decision To Study At RMIT</h3>
<pre class="pre"; style="font-size: 13px; color:white;">
Although my prior educational experience, mainly VCE, assisted in obtaining basic knowledge and skills in a variety of fields and a general sense of my limits as an individual,
the choice to enroll in a Bachelor of Information Technology was an obvious choice given my acute fascination in the academically diverse course.
The choice to indulge in the bachelor's program was based on my goal to enhance my understanding about the field,
to seek to secure a place among the variety of available employment opportunities and to further legitimize my educational status.
Growing up in the age of technological revolution, my interaction with computing and telecommunications devices was inevitable beginning at the age of 6.
My initial interaction revolved basic web surfing, watching YouTube tutorials and Rom/DVD based emulation.
As a result of this discovery, I was instantly captivated by IT's complexity, expansiveness and overall implementation in everyday life.
</pre>
<h3 class="h3"; style="font-size: 15px; color:lightgoldenrodyellow;">Prominent Figures and Personal Inspirations</h3>
<pre class="pre"; style="font-size: 13px; color:white;">
Since a very early age, I was always intrigued by the intricacy of technology and how it interacts with our everyday lives.
By the age of 10, I held my first iPhone and explored the features, applications and even the internals of the device.
The phone was a gift from my uncle who first introduced me to technology.
During the time, we would read tech magazines, watch seminars and complete online surveys to examine our understanding about concepts which was mainly hardware related.
He provided me with a passion for the subject, ultimately reinforcing my decision to study at RMIT.
Another key influence which sparked my interest in IT was a popular youtuber going by the name Linus Tech Tips.
Although my encounter with his content was later in life, his representation of computer systems, internet security and diagnostics,
consolidated the fact that technology not only provides us with infinite possibilities but improves our ability to communicate and express who we are as individuals
</pre>
<h3 class="h3"; style="font-size: 15px; color:lightgoldenrodyellow;">Why I choose RMIT?</h3>
<pre class="pre"; style="font-size: 13px; color:white;">
Although the concept of completing VCE and moving into adulthood was frightening at first,
the prospect of finding employment in the IT industry through a ternary course, invigorated my confidence, self-esteem and hope for the future.
Through VTAC, I was presented with a variety of courses in which I studied intuitively for hours.
After consulting with professionals, completing quizzes and analyzing my understanding of basic elements I made an informed choice to study a Bachelor of Information Technology.
The only difficulty was the variety of ternary education providers  across Victoria. I began to explore my options, looking for a provider that follows a form of blended learning.
Through a quick array of google searches, I came across the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and was certain that this would be my home for the next 3-4 years beginning in 2022.
</pre>
<h3 class="h3"; style="font-size: 15px; color:lightgoldenrodyellow;">Expectations at RMIT</h3>
<pre class="pre"; style="font-size: 13px; color:white">
The Bachelor’s Degree in Information Technology lasts approximately four years or 16 semesters total.
Review of the RMIT homepage highlights a basic course structure with 32 units to be completed, some of which are minor subjects.
The degree is built on the credit point system with each course delivering 12 credit points for a passing grade.
The subjects I’m most interested in revolving around cyber security, system maintenance and database design.
The course covers a variety of fields including programming, cloud computing, user authentication, user centered design etc.
The difficulty of understanding concepts varies between subject with some more practical than others.
Overall, my personal expectations for the course are of a high standard though, hard work and dedication to my studies including assessments will most definitely resolve many personal doubts along the way
</pre>
<h2 class="h2"; style="font-size: 20px; color:goldenrod">My Ideal Job</h2>
<pre class="pre"; style="font-size: 13px; color:white;">
My ideal vision of future employment entails a stable and autonomous form of work in which I can provide extensive support and maintenance on computer systems.
The working hours I would expect is an eight to ten-hour workday for a maximum of 5 days a week full-time.
This will ensure a sense of fulfillment & achievement which will further compel me to maintain a professional mindset and ensure that I’m motivated to continue operating within the organization.
A minute but critical feature of my employment would include a nearby, accessible and connected location to increase productivity and fortify time management extensively.
</pre>
<pre class="pre"; style="font-size: 13px; color:white;">
After a lengthy and detailed research session, the prospect of future employment in graduate positions was abundant and varied.
Almost all required a bachelor’s degree in information technology, some even detailing that no prior work experience is necessary.
Such opportunities provide condensed and highly valuable forms of experience which may be necessary for higher forms of employment in the future.
Through the extended period of research, one advertised position drew my attention, potentially fulfilling many of my future targets after graduating.
Advertised on seek.com.au, multiple positions as an IT System Support Analyst at the David Jones & Country Road Group were open,
providing work placement aimed at lower qualified individuals and graduate students.
The organization provides opportunities for professional mediation and consultation to analyse work efficacy in a variety of aspects.
Interactions with management teams are also commonplace, assisting in maintaining professional integrity and having an in-depth understanding of workplace objectives.
In addition, I would also like to explore open tech support positions to increase my confidence in the field as well as develop appropriate skills to that which larger companies desire.
</pre>
<pre class="pre"; style="font-size: 13px; color:white;">
The position has some qualifications differing from other advertisements of the same calibre.
As mentioned earlier, entry level positions require a bachelor’s degree in information technology or equivalent.
The description in the advertisement also states that experience in windows and SQL servers is favourably looked upon.
Experience working with mobile devices including apple, android tablets etc, can improve the odds of being employed.
Additional queries may be brought up regarding vaccination status, citizenship, relational database management system experience and account package experience.
To date, my level of experience in these fields is limited.
Many of the skills listed above will require further knowledge and skill which can be obtained through several means including the completion of the bachelor’s program.
Nevertheless, the much rewarding position as an IT system support analyst advertised requires experience,
qualifying degrees and complementary traits which can be steadily obtained throughout the next several years.

<pre class="pre"; style="font-size: 13px; color:white;">
5/10 – Ability to learn new information is average,
slightly reduced chance of gaining access to employment related activities including,
job interviews, meetings, internships

</pre>
<h3 class="h3"; style="font-size: 15px; color:lightgoldenrodyellow">Profile: Reflection on Results</h3>
<pre class="pre"; style="font-size: 13px; color:white;">
Critical analysis of the results from the Myer-Briggs,Learning Styles and IPC Psychometric tests, demonstrate a great divide between my personality and cognitive abilities.
In scale, the Myer-Briggs personality test is by far the most important in calculating my personal strengths and flaws as an individual.
Results show that at times I’m dismissive of my emotions as well being overly critical which are true to a great extent especially in recent years.
The results also highlight that independency is a strength in that I can maintain my emotions during high-stress situations.
Comparably, the learning styles test, and psychometric evaluation provide insight into my work and school life.
The learning styles test concludes that a visual and auditory method of learning is most effective this includes completing charts,
diagrams, taking physical notes and viewing lectures. On the other hand, the IPC psychometrics test evaluated my ability to learn new information.
The score given was a 5/10 which is below the national average.
Results from these quizzes indicate that forms of emotional and social training and support are required to ensure a healthy lifestyle,
which I hope to achieve in the near future.
</pre>
<h3 class="h3"; style="font-size: 15px; color:lightgoldenrodyellow">Profile: Implmenting Change</h3>
<pre class="pre"; style="font-size: 13px; color:white;">
Working in a team is fundamental in that it increases workplace efficiency,
reduces one’s workload and improves your socialisation skills in a variety of ways.
As mentioned earlier the Myers-Briggs test highlights my unwillingness to work with others.This in reality is improper and ineffective,
both in the workplace and in general.
This along with the lower-than-average psychometric score of 5/10 and the preferred method of learning,
indicates a severe deficiency in social ability. Without basic social skills,
performance will remain at less than desired unless major changes are implemented.
</pre>
<h3 class="h3"; style="font-size: 15px; color:lightgoldenrodyellow">Profile: Selecting Groups</h3>
<pre class="pre"; style="font-size: 13px; color:white;">
Forming, working and mediating with a team can be seen as a daunting task to some.
Ensuring that all team members are aware of objectives, guidelines and performance is key.
The results obtained from all three tests clearly demonstrate that as an individual,
I must take charge of ensuring that my group and I are effectively communicating to an appropriate standard.
My ability to express my emotions and feelings is also important so that others can clearly understand,
comprehend how I’m feeling and visualise the direction I’m taking during group work.
The initial selection process in forming a group should be done with a specific mindset so that members individual weaknesses are mitigated by other strengths,
providing stability and reassurance in completing set tasks.

<h2 class="h2"; style="font-size: 20px; color:goldenrod">Project Idea: Multi-Management Android Application</h2>
<img src="Manage.jpg" alt="Manage Pic" width="500" height="300" align="right">
<h3 class="h3"; style="font-size: 15px; color:lightgoldenrodyellow">Project Idea: Overview</h3>
<pre class="pre"; style="font-size: 13px; color:white;">
The utilization of mobile technology in professional and everyday applications is becoming increasingly apparent.
For my personal IT project, I wanted to explore the further implementation of smart devices such as phones and tablets in an everyday setting.
The project will involve the construction of a basic multi-management android application/tool  using MIT app inventor and/or various other means.
The application will allow the user to input personal, health related and situational information about themselves forming an individual profile.
This information can then be viewed, edited or analysed by the user.
The application is directed at allowing them to manage and express themselves through self-evaluation.

</pre>
<h3 class="h3"; style="font-size: 15px; color:lightgoldenrodyellow">Project Idea: Motivations</h3>
<pre class="pre"; style="font-size: 13px; color:white;">
My personal interest in constructing this particular android application originated from my personal struggles in life.
Throughout the past couple of years, social anxiety and a host of medical problems made it extremely difficult to manage my personal responsibilities and fulfill my aspirations in life.
An article published on Bizfluent by Wanda Thibodeaux <a href="https://www.inc.com/author/wanda-thibodeaux">More info,</a> states that scheduling,
organising and simplifying tasks help in “contributing to the short-term and long-term goals of [an] organisation” as well as substantially “improve employee morale”.
This statement helps generate the idea that organizing, planning and reviewing your responsibilities can in fact, improve your ability to overcome difficulties,
satisfy goals while maintain good mental. The use of an application to keep record of personal information is cost efficient, easily accessible and confidential.
</pre>
<h3 class="h3"; style="font-size: 15px; color:lightgoldenrodyellow">Project Idea: Details</h3>
<pre class="pre"; style="font-size: 13px; color:white;">
In general, android applications contain a variety of features and basic structural elements which I hope to emulate for this project.
The application is directed toward individuals who find it difficult to manage everyday activities from work related assignments to their health and wellbeing.
Through the use of crucial software including <a href="https://www.appypie.com/">Appy Pie</a> and <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a>,
I will be able to effectively design an elaborate and highly sophisticated application with the intent of successfully deploying it prior to given deadlines.
</pre>
<pre class="pre"; style="font-size: 13px; color:white;">
The structural components of the application will be constructed through basic programming techniques and templates.
<a href="https://www.appypie.com/">Appy Pie</a> is a software application which can be used to download pre-existing templates,
elements and components allowing for increased productivity and a reduction in completion time.
Through the use of this form of software, I will implement a minimalist design through suggested methods of styling,
categorization and compartmentalisation to ensure that all user types can successfully navigate and manipulate the applications array of features.
</pre>
<pre class="pre"; style="font-size: 13px; color:white;">
In itself, the application will contain three of the following sections: A home screen where the user can note anything that’s on their mind such including thoughts about world events,
current emotional state or their opinions about others.The home screen will also prompt the user on initial entry,
to input basic information about themselves which will be stored and employed in the profile building phase.
The secondary component of the application involves a settings menu in which the user can edit their profile information,
profile image, read the assistance and FAQ sections as well viewing future updates and changes.
The final component of the application involves a rudimentary timetabling system hosting upcoming events,
important dates including personalised recommendations based on your profile status with an ability to set your own goals and note down individual achievements.
</pre>
<pre class="pre"; style="font-size: 13px; color:white;">
Although still undecided, the application may utilize other features present within most modern-day mobile phones and software.
Some of these features may include SMS/messaging services to share personal goals and thoughts with others,
use of the internet services to import information or images to reduce need to fill out every component in the profile building section.
The application will employ a friend’s section where the user can import friends from their contacts list.
This feature will surely increase user engagement by providing a means of communication.
This feature may be implemented early on in the design process in order to build a basic link between the user and the application.
</pre>
<pre class="pre"; style="font-size: 13px; color:white;">
Overall, the application will include a variety of features, all of which will be carefully considered and directed towards the user’s experience.
Software and web-based services like Appy Pie and Figma will ensure that the application has a relatively refined structure,
well balanced design and layout along with significant functionality.
The applications relative complexity will require a significant level of understanding which will be obtained through basic tutorials,
videos and practical exercises. Nevertheless, the management application will condense many basic mobile applications into a single,
minimalistic and organised tool, allowing the user to manage all aspects of life in the palm of their hands.
</pre>
<h3 class="h3"; style="font-size: 15px; color:lightgoldenrodyellow">Required Software & Tools</h3>
<pre class="pre"; style="font-size: 13px; color:white;">
<img src="Tools.jpg" alt="Tools Pic" width="160" height="160" align="center">
During the construction process of the application, various essential forms of software will be utilized.
As I have no prior experience in planning and building an application, I will use basic tools including Appy Pie which is a web-based android app development tool.
The application uses a simple drag and drop system, requiring very little coding/programming experience.
Other web-based services like <a href="https://www.lucidchart.com/pages/">Lucid Charts</a> can be very useful in the planning phase of developing the application.
Further web-based services such as Figma will be required in designing and prototyping the applications user interface and design.
A fully operational android device such as a tablet or mobile phone is required.
This device will be required to run the latest version of android as this will minimize the risk of errors,
with addition to increased overall performance and stability
</pre>
<h3 class="h3"; style="font-size: 15px; color:lightgoldenrodyellow">Required Skills and Knowledge</h3>
<pre class="pre"; style="font-size: 13px; color:white;">
The process of constructing a sophisticated mobile application is extensive and difficult task.
I currently have no prior or current experience in the field. To correct this issue, I will be watching online tutorials,
reading articles and utilizing much more condensed and ‘simple’ forms of application development software such as Appy Pie.
Although not required, basic programming skills and user centred design elements can improve the overall function and aesthetic of the end product.
The feasibility in attaining these skills is achievable to some extent, as sources like YouTube, Wikipedia,
w3 Schools and additional articles can increase the understanding of basic concepts and aide in consolidating pre-existing knowledge.
</pre>
<h3 class="h3"; style="font-size: 15px; color:lightgoldenrodyellow">Result and Outcomes</h3>
<pre class="pre"; style="font-size: 13px; color:white;">
<img src="Outcome.jpg" alt="Target Pic" width="160" height="160" align="center">
Although unlikely, if the application is successfully deployed and functional within the given time period, many favourable outcomes will be established.
The applications ability to store information including dates, important events,
personal and health related information and condense this into a detailed profile,
greatly reduces the need for physical scheduling tools or multiple applications.
Other than everyday users, some individuals who are medically diagnosed with mental health conditions including,
<a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/obsessive-compulsive-disorder">Obsessive Compulsive Disorder(OCD)</a> and <a href="https://www.betterhealth.vic.gov.au/health/conditionsandtreatments/attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-adhd">ADHD</a> struggle in remaining attentive and focused.
The applications condensed and organised layout can minimalize exposure to large amounts of information while also markedly simplifying daily tasks into a digestible form.
This innovation is not only directed at enhancing the management abilities of the user,
but also sustainably improving my personal understanding in software development and computer systems in general.
