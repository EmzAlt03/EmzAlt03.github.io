<h1 style="color:floralwhite;">My Personal IT Profile</h1>
<h2 style="color:floralwhite;">BIO ABOUT ME</h2>
<p style="color:black;">My name is Emre Altunsu, and I have enjoyed one activity and that is using the internet. My family is originally from Turkey, having no creditable knowledge about information technologies and their applications as a result of financial hardship as well as the isolated culture. I have completed my VCE and achieved an ATAR score of 83.24 which surprised me as, fun fact, during 2021 I lost all my notes, worksheets and assessments. While waiting for the bus to arrive a gust of wind opened my bag and all contents flew across the bus terminal, but I managed to catch up just in time for exams. I have found that studying information technology at RMIT has really provided a true understanding of the expansiveness of technology and how it has impacted humanity since its discovery. I applied for this course to enhance knowledge on the field, to gain quality experience and begin to form a professional mindset when it comes to employment.
</p>
<h3 style="color:floralwhite;">My Decision To Study At RMIT</h3>
<p style="color:black;">Although my prior educational experience, mainly VCE, assisted in obtaining basic knowledge and skills in a variety of fields and a general sense of my limits as an individual, the choice to enroll in a Bachelor of Information Technology was an obvious choice given my acute fascination in the academically diverse course. The choice to indulge in the bachelor's program was based on my goal to enhance my understanding about the field, to seek to secure a place among the variety of available employment opportunities and to further legitimize my educational status. Growing up in the age of technological revolution, my interaction with computing and telecommunications devices was inevitable beginning at the age of 6. My initial interaction revolved basic web surfing, watching YouTube tutorials and Rom/DVD based emulation. As a result of this discovery, I was instantly captivated by IT's complexity, expansiveness and overall implementation in everyday life.
</p>
<h3 style="color:floralwhite;">Prominent Figures and Personal Inspirations</h3>
<p style="color:black;">Since a very early age, I was always intrigued by the intricacy of technology and how it interacts with our everyday lives. By the age of 10, I held my first iPhone and explored the features, applications and even the internals of the device. The phone was a gift from my uncle who first introduced me to technology. During the time, we would read tech magazines, watch seminars and complete online surveys to examine our understanding about concepts which was mainly hardware related. He provided me with a passion for the subject, ultimately reinforcing my decision to study at RMIT. Another key influence which sparked my interest in IT was a popular youtuber going by the name Linus Tech Tips. Although my encounter with his content was later in life, his representation of computer systems, internet security and diagnostics consolidated the fact that technology not only provides us with infinite possibilities but improves our ability to communicate and express who we are as individuals
</p>
<h3 style="color:floralwhite;">Why I choose RMIT?</h3>
<p style="color:black;">Although the concept of completing VCE and moving into adulthood was frightening at first, the prospect of finding employment in the IT industry through a ternary course, invigorated my confidence, self-esteem and hope for the future. Through VTAC, I was presented with a variety of courses in which I studied intuitively for hours. After consulting with professionals, completing quizzes and analyzing my understanding of basic elements I made an informed choice to study a Bachelor of Information Technology. The only difficulty was the variety of ternary education providers  across Victoria. I began to explore my options, looking for a provider that follows a form of blended learning. Through a quick array of google searches, I came across the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and was certain that this would be my home for the next 3-4 years beginning in 2022.</p>
<h3 style="color:floralwhite;">Expectations at RMIT</h3>
<p style="color:black;">The Bachelor’s Degree in Information Technology lasts approximately four years or 16 semesters total. Review of the RMIT homepage highlights a basic course structure with 32 units to be completed, some of which are minor subjects. The degree is built on the credit point system with each course delivering 12 credit points for a passing grade. The subjects I’m most interested in revolving around cyber security, system maintenance and database design. The course covers a variety of fields including programming, cloud computing, user authentication, user centered design etc. The difficulty of understanding concepts varies between subject with some more practical than others. Overall, my personal expectations for the course are of a high standard though, hard work and dedication to my studies including assessments will most definitely resolve many personal doubts along the way</p>
