<h2 style="color:darkslategrey;"; style="font-family:Garamond, serif;">Short Bio About Me</h2>
<p style="color:darkslategrey;"; style="font-family:Garamond, serif;">My name is Emre Altunsu, and I have enjoyed one activity and that is using the internet. My family is originally from Turkey, having no creditable knowledge about information technologies and their applications as a result of financial hardship as well as the isolated culture. I have completed my VCE and achieved an ATAR score of 83.24 which surprised me as, fun fact, during 2021 I lost all my notes, worksheets and assessments. While waiting for the bus to arrive a gust of wind opened my bag and all contents flew across the bus terminal, but I managed to catch up just in time for exams. I have found that studying information technology at RMIT has really provided a true understanding of the expansiveness of technology and how it has impacted humanity since its discovery. I applied for this course to enhance knowledge on the field, to gain quality experience and begin to form a professional mindset when it comes to employment.

<h2 style="color:darkslategrey;"; style="font-family:Garamond, serif;">My Decision To Study At RMIT</h2>
<p style="color:darkslategrey;"; style="font-family:Garamond, serif;">Although my prior educational experience, mainly VCE, assisted in obtaining basic knowledge and skills in a variety of fields and a general sense of my limits as an individual, the choice to enroll in a Bachelor of Information Technology was an obvious choice given my acute fascination in the academically diverse course. The choice to indulge in the bachelor's program was based on my goal to enhance my understanding about the field, to seek to secure a place among the variety of available employment opportunities and to further legitimize my educational status. Growing up in the age of technological revolution, my interaction with computing and telecommunications devices was inevitable beginning at the age of 6. My initial interaction revolved basic web surfing, watching YouTube tutorials and Rom/DVD based emulation. As a result of this discovery, I was instantly captivated by IT's complexity, expansiveness and overall implementation in everyday life.
